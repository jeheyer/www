<H3><TT>(Frequently Asked Stupid Questions)</TT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">These are questions that keep popping up on newsgroups, mailing lists, 
and bulletin boards.  Make no mistake about it, I <EM>love</EM> getting 
and writing E-Mail, but hopefully this will save a few people some time (as FAQs are designed to do).</FONT></P>

<H4><TT>Q: What's the secret word for the Rhinoplasty Enhanced CD?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> "violin"  You can just view the movie by itself by browsing 
the CD for "devil.mov"</P>

<H4><TT>Q: Are Les Claypool and Lester Claypool (Suicidal Tendacies and Alkatraz prodcuer) the same person?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> No! No! No!  There seems to be a lot of confusion about this since Lester may have been affilated with 
Metallica somehow.  But they are two completely different, unrelated people.  This has been confirmed both by 
David Leftkowitz (Primus's Manager), and Bob Cock at primussucks.com.  Besides, if you look at Les's history in the 
80s, you realize it's basically impossible.  Les spent the early 80s with Tommy Crank Band and Blind Illusion and had 
to both sell his car and borrow money to get things with Primus rolling the late 80s.  Given his financial situation, 
producing major releases would have been impossible. </P>

<H4><TT>Q: Is Les in a movie called <U>Kung Foo Rascals</U>?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> Again, that's another, totally unrelated Les Claypool.</P>

<H4><TT>Q: Why did Herb Leave?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> There's a very good 
<A HREF="http://www.addict.com/radio/In_The_Lab_With/Claypool,_Les/Part3-28.ram">interview</A> with Les in 
<A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com">realaudio</A> in which he explains what
happend.  If you can't do realaudio, I haven't transcribed the whole thing, 
but the gist of it can be found <A HREF="../info/herb.txt">here</A>.</P>

<H4><TT>Q: My Enhanced CD doesn't work, what should I do?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> The Enhanced CD was written in a format incompatible with the newer 
CD-ROM drives, so there's really no way to cure it.  There are, however, several ways
to get around using the CD-ROM drive, which can be found at my <A HREF="enhanced.htm">
Enhanced CD</A> Page.</P>

<H4><TT>Q: What's Herb doing now?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> He'll get back together with two of the guys from 
<A HREF="http://www.dlc.fi/~vesama/laundry/laundry.htm">Laundry</A> to record an album soon.</P>

<H4><TT>Q: I hate the Brown Album, what should I do?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> Well, I'm sorry to hear that, because I love it.  Think of it this way: 
it's better than Punchbowl, so what have you got to complain about?</P>

<H4><TT>Q: How do you do your Page?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> I Know HTML, so I don't have to rely on 
an editor such as FrontPage.  Generally, I just use the Emacs editor 
on my Linux Box at home.  If you don't want to take 
the time to learn HTML, but want to create a web page, I'd recommend Netscape Composer 
(it comes with Netscape 4.0)  FrontPage is total crap.  </P>

<HR>
<H3><TT>Really Stupid Questions</TT></H3>
<H4><TT>Q: That Girl in the <EM>Shake Hands with Beef</EM> video is fine; who is she?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> She's not fuckin' Claire Daines, that's for sure.</P>

<H4><TT>Q: Are there any Chicks who Like Primus?</TT></H4>
<P><B>A:</B> Yes, there are 3 of them. They live in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</P>
