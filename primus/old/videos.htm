<TD><A NAME="john"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>John the Fisherman</B> was Primus's first official video (a demo for <B>Too 
Many Puppies</B> exists, but was never officially released).  Shot on Les's Fishing Boat, 
it featured a cameo by Kirk Hammett and Ler's Purple Hair.  This video 
appears on the <A HREF="cheesvid.htm">Cheesy Home Video</A> with an introduction 
by Les of "I Don't Wanna Introduce The video for John the Fisherman...Fuck That!".

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/jerry.jpg" ALT="Jerry was a Racecar Driver"><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="jerry"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Jerry Was a Racecar Driver</B> featered Primus in concert 
at the legendary Phoenix Theater.  Les wears his classic white Long Johns, and needless 
to say, the moshing at the concert is quite heavy.  The introduction shows
the infamous <A HREF="http://www.primussucks.com">Bob Cock</A> getting an order of Nachos, only to drop 
them after a collision with <A HREF="lalonde.htm">Ler</A> on a skateboard.

<TD><A NAME="tommy"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Tommy the Cat</B> is possibly Primus's most bizarre video.  
Les plays a bartender serving milk, which is mixed with the rest of the Band and a cartoon.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://media.bastardboat.com/video/excerpt-My_Name_Is_Mud.mov"><IMG SRC="graphics/mud.jpg" ALT="My Name is Mud"></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="mud"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>My Name is Mud</B> was the first Primus video to get heavy 
play on MTV, and likewise was reviewed by <A HREF="http://fred.net/cheesy/beavis.shtml">Beavis and 
Butt-head</A>.  Many fans were introduced to Les Claypool's hard, slappin' bass and 
masterful story telling with this video; the song was a tribute to the director of <U>Evil Dead</U>.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/dmv.jpg" ALT="DMV"><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="dmv"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Like Jerry, the video for <B>DMV</B> takes place mostly in concert. 
A great example of the sheer energy of Primus, Les does the famous "Primus Jig" 
towards the end.  MTV bleeped out both "THC" and "Smoke", foreshadowing future censorship 
for the <A HREF="#wynona">Wynona</A> video two years later.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/krinkle.jpg" ALT="Mr. Krinkle"><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="krinkle"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Very few have been lucky enough to see the video for <B>Mr. Krinkle</B>, 
as it is by far the least played.  As Les put it, "I put my heart and soul into that video, 
and they played it like two times."  The video featured Les in a pig suit 
playing the upright with all types of weird things going on in the background.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/riddles.jpg" ALT="Riddles Are Abound Tonight"><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="riddles"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Simply put, <B>Riddles Are Abound Tonight</B> was a weird video.  Dressed in 
blue bodysuits and ridding stationary bicyles, Sausage performs the song while hovering above a 
Disco dancer and a 1700's ball.  Thanks to Beavis and Butt-head, Sausage became better known 
as the "Seminifious Tubloidial Buttnoids", and the video was responsible for insiring Mike Judge 
to create <EM>The Great Cornholio</EM>.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/wynona.jpg" ALT="Wynona's Big Brown Beaver"><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="wynona"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Wynona's Big Brown Beaver</B> is considered by most to be the 
best video.  Dressed as Cowboys in plastic suits resembling the Duracell Family, it mixed 
the threesome's adventures with cartoons.  Unfortuneately, MTV both censored the video 
and restricted its playing time to past midnight, much to the dismay of the band.
Despite this, it was still was the most requested video of 1995.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://media.bastardboat.com/video/excerpt-Southbound_Pachyderm.mov"><IMG SRC="graphics/pacyderm.jpg" ALT="Southbound Pacyderm"></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="pacyderm"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Southbound Pacyderm</B> was done almost entirely in claymation.  
In the video, a safari hunter persues a flying Elephant and Hippo who are aided by a scientist.  
Like <B>Mr. Krinkle</B>, this video was played only a few times after its premeire.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://media.bastardboat.com/video/excerpt-Shake_Hands_With_Beef.mov"><IMG SRC="graphics/beef.jpg" ALT="Shake Hands with Beef"></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="beef"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Shake Hands with Beef</B> marked the debut of 
<A HREF="brain.htm">Brain</A> in a Primus video.  The video took place at a 
trailer park barbeque, with the guys as little insects performing on a garbage can lid.  Ler flew during his solo, 
but Les was fried by a bug zapper at the end.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://media.bastardboat.com/video/excerpt-Over_The_Falls.mov"><IMG SRC="graphics/falls.jpg" ALT="Over the Falls"></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="falls"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><B>Over the Falls</B> reflected the old-fashioned, acoustic 
feel of 1997's <EM>Brown Album</EM>.  Dressed in early 1900's duds, the band performs as several 
Whoudina-bees attempt to cross Niagara Falls in homemade contraptions.  Many of the tools came from Les's 
Grandfather's (Captain Peirce) garage.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/buzzards.jpg" ALT="Buzzards of Green Hill"></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="buzzards"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The <B>Buzzards of Green Hill</B> video 
perhaps stayed closest to the song.  It primary shows Les and the Frog Brigade displaying the lyrics 
on cue cards, but mixes in "home movie" shots of Green Hill Road and the Buzzards that patrol it, and 
a little of Les playing.
