<TD><A NAME="suck"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P><P><B>Suck on This</B> was recorded in February 1989 in 
Berkeley Square, CA.  It featured such memorable quotes as "Herb the Ginseng Drummer", "Larry You're 
a Bastard", and "We're Primus, we Suck".  Of course, it also had an awesome version of Tommy 
the Cat with one of Les's best solos.  With the exception of "The Heckler", all the songs appeared on other Primus albums 
or soundtracks.

<TD><A NAME="friz"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>After selling Suck on This (with some success) to 
local record stores, Primus got on the Caroline records label and recorded their first studio album.  
<B>Frizzle Fry</B> had 13 tracks, including Primus's first hit <EM>John the Fisherman</EM>.  With 
other trash/metal/funk songs as <EM>Pudding Time</EM>, <EM>Too Many Puppies</EM>, and <EM>To Defy the Laws of Tradition</EM>, 
many fans consider this their favorite album.  In case you're wondering what the title's about, 
Claypool was doing a <U>lot</U> of acid at the time.

<TD><A NAME="cheese"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>After leaving Caroline, Primus talked with several record companies 
before finding Interscope.  <B>Sailing the Seas of Cheese</B> dealt with Frizzle Fry's success and the soul-searching that 
followed it.  It is considered the most angry and anarchistic album, and is typically the most critically aclaimed with masterful 
bass work on the hits <EM>Jerry was a Racecar Driver</EM> and <EM>Tommy the Cat</EM> and the unusual rhythms of <EM>Eleven</EM> 
and <EM>Those Damn Blue-Collar Tweekers</EM>, which became classic songs with fans.

<TD><A NAME="debris"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>In 1992, Primus toured mostly but took enough time 
to do a small EP of covers. <B>Miscellaneous Debris</B> was the first album to candidly show Claypool's interest 
in the Residents, as <EM>Sinister Exaggerator</EM> was featured.  The album also included XTC's 
<EM>Making Plans for Nigel</EM>, Pink Floyd's <EM>Have a Cigar</EM>, and two other songs.

<TD><A NAME="porksoda"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Shocking the music industry by premeiring at number 8 on the charts, 1993's <B>Pork Soda</B> nearly cast Primus into 
mainstream popularity with the top ten hit <EM>My Name is Mud</EM>, which drew heavy play both 
on radio and MTV.  Ironically, the title "Pork Soda" symbolized Primus's music as something disgusting no one wanted.  Fans also enjoyed <EM>DMV</EM>, 
<EM>Nature Boy</EM>, <EM>Welcome to this World</EM>, <EM>Mr. Krinkle</EM>, and of course the legendary <EM>Hamburger Train</EM> (a 9 minute 
instrumental).

<TD><A NAME="riddles"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>In 1994, Primus took a break from each other to work on 
side projects.  Les Claypool's sideproject was Sausage, and their album was <B>Riddles Are Abound Tonight</B>.
More jazzy and experimental than Primus, the <A HREF="videos.htm#riddles">video</A> for the title track was one of the most bizarre in history, 
and inspired Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head) to create the Great Cornholio.

<TD ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="graphics/tale_cov.jpg"><IMG SRC="graphics/sm_tales.jpg" ALT="Tales From the Punchbowl" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=118 BORDER=0></A><BR></TD>
<TD><A NAME="tales"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Despite the grammy-nominated hit <EM>Wynona's Big Brown Beaver</EM>, 
<B>Tales From the Punchbowl</B> is considered by many to be the weakest Primus album.  The album continues 
on many of the ideas from Seas of Cheese and Pork Soda, but still manages to sound different.  It was the first 
ablum where Ler's parts took the melody rather than Les, and like Pork Soda, premeired at number 8.

<TD><A NAME="highball"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Shortly following the change of drummers in Summer 1996 (Tim left 
and Brain joined), Les Claypool released his first solo album, called <B>Highball with the Devil</B>.  Although Les 
plays bass, guitar and even drums for most of the album, he is helped out by Jay Lane, MIRV, and Joe Gore on a few 
tracks.  The album received no radio play and produced no videos, but nonetheless was the number 3 college radio 
alternative Album that year.

<TD><A NAME="brown"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>With Brain behind the set, <B>Brown Album</B> marked the 
beginning of a new era for Primus.  Blessed with a new energy, Primus explored its macabre side with 
such eerily delightful songs as <EM>Fisticuffs</EM>, <EM>Over the Falls</EM>, and <EM>Kalamazoo</EM>.  The album also touched on Primus's earlier 
work with such songs as the new foot-stoppin' favorite <EM>Puddin' Taine</EM> and the mood-shifting 
<EM>Return of Sathington Willoby</EM>.  Despite the abscence of a first hit single, the album still 
premeired at number 21 on the charts and the band played the HORDE festival in the summer.

<TD><A NAME="brown"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>Despite touring heavily in the year 
following Brown, the band somehow managed to find the time to record <B>Rhinoplasty</B>, the 
1998 followup to Miscellaneous Debris.  Taking its name from the <EM>South Park</EM> cartoon, the EP included 
once again covers of Peter Gabriel and XTC, along ones by with the Police, Stanley Clarke, and Metallica, plus two 
live tracks from the last <EM>New Year's Freakout</EM>.  While the album was released in May in Europe, the US version 
was delayed until August so an Enhanced CD-ROM could be completed.

<TD><A NAME="antipop"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P>
Right after working on side projects with Buckethead and Tom Waits, the band went 
back to the studio in the summer of '99 to record <B>AntiPop</B>, their 9th 
album.  Stylistically, Primus decided to do a harder, more fan-oriented album, 
in the style of <A HREF="#friz">Frizzle Fry</A>.  Several friends 
such as Tom Morello, Fred Durst, and Stewart Copeland produced songs, and the 
recording of Oz Fritz and mixing of Toby Wright made for a cleaner sound than before.  
Favorites include <EM>Electric Uncle Sam</EM>, <EM>Lacquerhead</EM>, 
<EM>Dirty Drowning Man</EM>, and the 8 minute <EM>Eclectric Electric</EM>.
