	<P>I just want to satisfy you.  I would like to rectify you.<BR>
	Pay no attention to what you've heard.  This mediocrity is so absurd.  <BR>
	But I won't listen to erratic advice. Don't make me ask you nice.<BR>
	I just want to satisfy you.  I would like to contemplate you.<BR>
	Perhaps sometime we'll irritate you.  I won't listen to sparratic advice.  <BR>
	Don't make me ask you twice.  I just want to satisfy you.</P>

	<P><I>Note: The other songs appear on other albums, so I only wrote them once.</I></P>

	<H3>To Defy the Laws of Tradition</H3>
	<P>What if Christmas didn't come this year, and no one paid for Christmas cheer?<BR>
	Who would cry the biggest tear - the child or the store?<BR>
	Why do brides wear virgin white?  Most do not deserve that right.<BR>
	But to choose a color of their delight, would surely bring on the frowns.<BR>
	<BR>
	To defy the laws of tradition, is a crusade only of the brave.<BR>
	<BR>    
	Suppose the taxman, he comes to town, and you don't lay your money down.<BR>
	Yet Mr. Jones, he killed Mr. Brown the other day.<BR>
	Well I wonder, who's gonna go to hell?</P>

	<H3>Groundhog's Day</H3>
	<P><I>Hey, Hey, Bob Cock Here....</I><BR>
	When I woke up this mornin' I felt a pang.  I was hungerin' for some apple pie.<BR>
	Stumble in the bathroom, hung my hog a little bit, washed the sleep out of my eye.<BR>
	Oh yeah, it's gonna be a fine day.<BR>
	<BR>
	Scratched myself a bit, poured me out a bowl-a corn chex, closest thing I could find to apple pie.<BR>
	Lingerin' taste of toothpaste made the milk go down a bit funny, but you know, them chex they do satisfy.<BR>
	Oh yeah, this'll be a fine day.<BR>
	<BR>
	So, after my mornin' rise-n-shine and eat-n-clean, had my mind set to hit them streets.<BR>
	Drizzle from the night left cold puddles out, had my black stomp-boots on my feet.<BR>
	It's my day.<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>Since I was in kneepants my pop had tried to make me realize, <BR>
	If I set my mind down to it I could be a big man in the public eye.  <BR>
	So with my big blue collar on, I set out to find the easy way. <BR>
	What an ice cold bath it was when I found you had to pay to play.  <BR>
	To taste the taste it's a tease that never would subside.  <BR>
	The taste is strong but soured by my learned eyes.  <BR>
	Well, if a woodchuck could chuck wood, he'd get down on his knees to pray.<BR>  
	This little snappy boy might see the light this ground hog's day.</I></P>       
	
	<H3>Too Many Puppies</H3>
	<P>Too many puppies are being shot in the dark.  Too many puppies are trained not to bark.<BR>
	At the sight of blood that must be spilled, so that we may maintain our oil fields.<BR>
	<BR>
	Too many puppies...<BR>
	<BR>
	Too many puppies are taught to heal.  Too many puppies are trained to kill.<BR>
	On the command of men wearing money belts, that buy mistresses sleek animal pelts.<BR>
	<BR>
	Too many puppies...<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>Peanut sat on a railroad track, his heart was all a flutter.<BR>
	Along came a train, turned him to peanut butter.</I><BR>
	<BR>
	Too many puppies with guns in their hands.  Too many puppies in foreign lands.<BR>
	Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine.<BR>
	Too many puppies are just like me.  Too many puppies are afraid to see.<BR>
	The visions of the past brought to life again.  Too many puppies, too many dead men.<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>El Sobrante Number One</I></P>

	<H3>Mr. Knowitall</H3>
	<P>They call me Mr. Knowitall.  I will not compromise.<BR>
	I will not be told what to do.  I shall not step aside.<BR>
	<BR>
	They call me Mr. Knowitall.  I have no time to waste.<BR>
	My mouth it spews pure intellect, and I've such elegant taste.<BR>
	<BR>
	They call me Mr. Knowitall.  I sup the aged wine.<BR>
	Oh I could tell such wonderous tales, if I should find the time.<BR>
	Well I must be Mr. Knowitall, for ideas they come in bounds.<BR>
	I am Mr. Knowitall, so spread the word around.<BR>
	<BR>
	They call me Mr. Knowitall, I am so eloquent.<BR>
	Perfection is my middle name, and whatever rhymes with eloquent...</P>

	<H3>Frizzle Fry</H3>
	<P>Hello all you boys and girls, I'd like to take you to the inside world.<BR>
	It's quite an irregular place to be, but never fear you're safe with me.<BR>
	Well, maybe....<BR>
	<BR>
	Golden hair of macrame', against the face that's cut from stone.<BR>
	The white porcelain is screaming Ayee!<BR>
	Thank God the the boy is not alone....<BR>
	<BR>
	I don't believe in Santa Claus.  I don't belive in spite.<BR>
	I have no use for beauty dolls.  Especially on this night.<BR>
	I don't believe in miracles.  I don't belive in lies.<BR>
	I don't belive in hologram.  For I am the Frizzle Fry.<BR>
	<BR>
	Andy's painting green again, this time they might take him away!<BR>
	When Barrington starts to breathe again.  It way just take us all away!<BR>
	I don't believe in charity.  I don't believe in sin.<BR>
	And if you don't believe in me, we'll play this tune over again.<BR>
	I don't believe in pinochle, and I don't beleive I'll try.<BR>
	I do believe in Captain Crunch, for I am the Frizzle Fry.<BR>
	Yes I am the Frizzle Fry.</P>

	<H3>John the Fisherman</H3>
	<P>When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school. <BR>
	His mind would turn unto the waters.<BR>
	Always the focus of adolescent ridicule,<BR>
	He has no time for farmer's daughters.<BR>
	Alienated from the clique society,<BR>
	A lonely boy finds peace in fishing.<BR>
	His mother says "John this is not the way life's supposed to be."<BR>
	"Don't you see the life that you are missing?"<BR>
	And he says...<BR>
	<BR>
	When I grow up I want to be, one of the harvesters of the sea.<BR>
	I think before my days are done, I want to be a fisherman.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now years gone by we find man that rules the sea.<BR>
	He sets out on a dark May morning .<BR>
	To bring his catch back to this small community.<BR>
	He doesn't see the danger dawning.<BR>
	Four hours up, oh the ocean swelled and swelled,<BR>
	The fog rolled in it started raining.<BR>
	"The starboard bow." "Oh my God we're going down!"<BR>
	The do not hear his frantic mayday.<BR>
	And he says...<BR>
	<BR>
	When I grow up I want to be, one of the harvesters of the sea.<BR>
	I think before my days are done, I want to be a fisherman.<BR>
	"I'll live and die a fisherman."<BR>
	Calling John the Fisherman...</P>
	
	<H3>The Toys go Winding Down</H3>

	<P>An overaged boy of thirty-nine has left the wing today.<BR>
	The first time in his life he's made that step.<BR>
	Be numbed by the society and plagued by insecurity.<BR>
	He's entered in a race that must be won.<BR>
	One of the animals has left its cage today.<BR>
	In search of better things so it seems to be.<BR>
	But in this land of polyurethane,<BR>
	Things are apt to get a bit hot.<BR>
	As the toys go winding down....<BR>
	<BR>
	C. G.  the Mexican is a friend of mine.<BR>
	We used to sit around the house watching evil dead.<BR>
	Talking about the way it used to be...<I>Skiddeley dit dad dow da day</I>.<BR>
	We used to pull the stripers out of Sand Pablo bay.<BR>
	Now the delta waters go down So. Cal.<BR>
	And the stripers start to fade away.<BR>
	It's pudding time!<BR>
	It's pudding time!<BR>
	As the toys go winding down.</P>

	<H3>Pudding Time</H3>
	<P>You can have a lolly popa candy bar a jelly bean.<BR>
	I'll buy you a rainbow to hang above your door.<BR>
	It's pudding time...<BR>
	<BR>
	Laughter is a sweet you can't put a price on.<BR>
	When laughter's all gone Daddy won't buy you more.<BR>
	It's pudding time...<BR>        It's pudding time children.<BR>
	<BR>    
	Money money money to buy you things,<BR>
	Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring.<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<BR>
	All the kings horses and all the kings men, Couldn't put Humpty together again.</I><BR>
	<BR>
	San Francisco bay the striped bass are dying.<BR>
	But you're gonna get that brand new bike.<BR>
	Oh joy!<BR>
	It's pudding time...<BR>
	It's pudding time children.</P>

	<H3>Sathington Willoby</H3>
	We are gathered here today in these majestic halls of old,<BR>
	to honor a man they call Sathington Willoughby.<BR>
	<BR>
	There's a joke or two, a pun or three, I feel that must be<BR>
	told then I go on to speak of Sathington Willoughby.<BR>
	<BR>
	Sathington Willoughby, the legislator that penned us up a bill.<BR>
	That banned the use of certain things like this and that...</P>

	<H3>Spegetti Western</H3>
	<P>Why do we do this C.G. and I?<BR>
	Every night vegetables, minds numbed up by THC.<BR>
	I've got my pen, C.G. the remote.<BR>
	Laurel and Hardy's the best bet at four A.M. On a Friday.<BR>
	No dreads about the working day after though.<BR>
	Funny thing about weekends when you're unemployed,<BR>
	They don't quite mean so much,<BR>
	'cept you get to hang out with all your working friends.<BR>
	Well we got us a spegetti western on 36.<BR>
	I like spegetti westerns.<BR>
	I like the way the boots are all reverbed out walking across the hardwood floors.<BR>
	In fact, everything's got that big reverb sound.<BR>
	Well what'll I do now? Go to sleep? Pull the pud?<BR>
	We need new pornos!  Well, I guess I'm still writing...</P>

	<H3>Harold of the Rocks</H3>
	<P>It was a weekend's eve, I had sex on my breath.<BR>
	I was lookin' for somethin' to see.<BR>
	With a borrowed black leather and my best fishin' hat,<BR>
	Well it was just Wendy O. and me.<BR>
	We called old Swamp up on the telephone,<BR>
	And said we was comin' on down to pick him up and then he said,<BR>
	"Hey Snappy, me and Greeny'll come along...<BR>
	But only if we can bring a friend."<BR>
	"His name is Harold."<BR>
	<BR>
	I said "Okay."<BR>
	Now, we had a Swamper, Greeny, Wendy O, Stanley, Harold of the Rocks and me.<BR>
	We hopped into my dart, and headed for the nightbreak,<BR>
	To see a man they call Schooly D.<BR>
	Harold he's a friendly guy, he rambles on and on,<BR>
	He'll talk the balls off a rhinosaurus.<BR>
	Fact is he just doesn't make much sense,<BR>
	Well  Stan said, "This guy's pretty bizarre Gus."<BR>
	<BR>
	Harold of the Rocks.<BR>
	<BR>
	I saw Harold at a party Trouzy threw late one night,<BR>
	I said, "hey man, do you remember me?"<BR>
	He said, "O' course I do Snapdad and let me tell ya right 'Bout now I'm lit<BR>
	Up like an ol' Christmas tree."<BR>
	"Hey bro you know I'd like to thank you once,<BR>
	Again for let'n me Hang with ya' all across the bay. <BR>
	When I look back at that night I get me a warm spot across my heart."<BR>
	Then he shook my hand, and walked away.<BR>
	That's the last I seen of Harold.<BR>
	<BR>
	Harold of the Rocks.<BR>
	So in the end, Swamper and Greeny finally succumb to the ways of Harold.<BR>
	And in doing so each gave just a little bit of his soul away.<BR>
	What a couple of dumbshits...</P>

	<H3>Eleven</H3>
	<P>I just can't seem to blend into society.<BR>
	I have no hope for this dim simplicity. <BR>
	Of law and order.<BR>
	By whose rules I see no rhyme in the reason,<BR>
	I hold no hope for this holy treason.<BR>
	Of love and so soft.<BR>
	By whose standards?<BR>
	They tell me, they tell me.<BR>
	Who are they, who is they?</P>

	<H3>Is It Luck?</H3>
	<P>My socks and shoes always match...Is it Luck?<BR>
	There's a foot at the end of each of my legs...Is it Luck?<BR>

	<H3>Grandpa's Little Dity</H3>
	<P>As I stand in the Shower, singing Opera and such...<BR>
	Pondering the possibility that I, pull the pud too much.<BR>
	There's a scent that fills the air...is it flatus?  Just a touch.<BR>
	And it makes me think of you...</P>

	<H3>Tommy the Cat</H3>
	<P><I>I remember as it were a meal ago</I><BR>
	Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever <BR>
	foreign matter may have nestled its way into His mighty throat.  <BR>
	Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank <BR>
	down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine.  <BR>
	Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator.  <BR>
	Tommy the cat had many a story to tell, <BR>
	but it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit.  <BR>
	The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the <BR>
	oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days.  <BR>
	The sight was beyond belief.  Many a head snapped for double,<BR>
	even triple, takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the<BR>
	delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbys were known to hang out.  <BR>
	They hung in droves.  Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in One place... <BR>
	and that was O'malley's Alley.  <BR>
	The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended) but not even a <BR>
	muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into the heart of the alley. <BR>
	 She knew what she wanted.  She was lookin' for that stud bull. <BR>
	She was looking for that key cat.  And that was me. <BR>
	 Tommy the Cat is my name, and I say unto thee...</I><BR>
	<BR>
	Say baby do you wanna lay down by me, say baby do you wanna' lay down by my side?</P>
	
	<H3>Those Damn Blue-Collar Tweekers</H3>
	<P>I've seen them out at Soco, they're pounding sixteen penny nails.<BR>
	The truckers on the interstate, have been known to ride the rails.<BR>
	The sweat is beating on the brow, can't keep these fellas down.<BR>
	'Cause those damned blue-collared tweekers are runnin' this here town.<BR>
	<BR>
	I knew a man who hung drywall, he hung it mighty quick.<BR>
	A trip or two to the blue room, would help him do the trick.<BR>
	His foreman would pat him on the back, whenever he would come around.<BR>
	'Cause these dammed blue-collar tweekers are beloved in this here town.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now the union boys are there to protect us from all the corporate type,<BR>
	While curious George's drug patrol is out here hunting snipe,<BR>
	Now they try to tell me different, but you know I ain't no clown.<BR>
	'Cause those damned blue-collar tweekers are the backbone of this town.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now the flame that burns twice as bright, burns only half as long.<BR>
	My eyes are growing weary as I finalize this song.<BR>
	So sit back and have a cup o' joe, and watch the wheels go round.<BR>
	'Cause those damned blue-collar tweekers have always run this town.</P>

	<H3>Fish On</H3>
	<P>Felt a pang late one afternoon, I was fishin' off Muir beach with Larry LeLonde.<BR>
	Grabbed a tuna salad sandwich, and I started to chew. Pretty soon Ler's yellin'-<BR>
	Fish on! Fish on!<BR>
	<BR>
	I was just a little pup, and it was derby day.<BR>
	Was dad and me and Darrell out in San Pablo bay.<BR>
	Taco flavored Doritos, and my orange life vest,<BR>
	Dad caught a hundred pound sturgeon on twenty-pound test.<BR>
	Now he fought that fish for an hour and a half,<BR>
	Darrell'd say "Jump ya sons a bitch!"<BR>
	And he grabbed for the gaff.<BR>
	When we got him in the boat he measured six feet long,<BR>
	I was so danged impressed I had to write a song -called Fish On!<BR>
	<BR>
	T'was a bright and sunny day it was me and Todd Huth.<BR>
	Fishin' shark & Stingray out of Bohuas Lagoon.<BR>
	Well hey, hey, hey I'll be screwed, blued and tatooed.<BR>
	Looks like I got me one of them. <BR>
	Fish on! Fish on!</P>

	Perhaps we'll have some fun tonight, so stick around and take a bite of life,<BR>
	We don't need feebleness in this proximity.<BR>

	Only to find him dangling in the apartment where he lived.<BR>
	<BR>
	I had a friend who shaved his head, put his Doctor Martins on,<BR>

	He praised my creativity, though he spoke sarcastically,<BR>
	Oh, the conversations in the apartment where he lived.<BR>

	<H3>The Ol' Diamondback Sturgeon</H3>

	Rooting and sniffing and urging to spawn, in the mud flats of San Pablo Bay.<BR>
	<BR>
	A scent came around so he followed his snout, he found what was to his surprise.<BR>
	A golden morsel, a tidbit, a tight bunch of grass shrimp, was there right before this buck's eyes.<BR>
	<BR>
	He circle round twice and he took a big whiff, then sucked up this savory meal.<BR>
	Then came a jolt and to the diamondback's surprise, through his lips cut the cold, barbed steel.<BR>
	<BR>
	In a panic the old diamondback sped to the north, he sped to the east, west and south.<BR>
	But the harder he swam, he still could not break free, from the "tugging" that pulled at his mouth.<BR>

	<BR>
	I pull my blinds, fill out my income tax form.  Pen in hand I write so legibly.<BR>
	I have my kitty. His name is Allowishus, I stroke him, stroke him....<BR>
	But you don't see me.  No one should see me<BR>
	<BR>
	I pull the blinds, for the sun glares off my tele and I find it quite so irritating.<BR>
	I have my videos -loads of Ren and Stimpy.  Bottom -a bit of pornography.<BR>
	But you don't see me.  No one should see me.</P>

	<BR>
	Ham and egg salad on white bread...keeps me company on nights like this.<BR>
	A pack of metholated cigarettes....keeps my air nice and thick.<BR>
	When I write, words flow like coins from a candy box.<BR>
	Get out of my way.  I've got something to say!<BR>
	<BR>
	The pulse is beating louder now.<BR>
	The cramps in my hands grow more intense with each tik, tik, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on the keys.<BR>
	My social life is at an end so it seems to be.  Why don't I trample on your lawn today?<BR>
	I'll take skies of blue, turn over old skies of grey.<BR>
	I write between the lines.  I deal with fantasy.<BR>
	I am the pressman.  Acknowledge me!<BR>

	He likes to hang out at Checker Gas with the Chets he knew from high school.<BR>

	But if you ask me twice I'd say the boy ain't worth a....<BR>

	Mrs. Blaileen began to chastise. She made him feel like an asshole.  Two feet small.<BR>
	Oh what a lonely boy....<BR>
	<BR>
	Don and Ronald.  They always stuck together.<BR>
	For they were a bit different than the others, and they were as tight as brothers.<BR>
	Then Ronald moved away.<BR>
	Now Steven, he was year or two younger.<BR>
	And he really thought he was something.  He liked to harass other children<BR>
	Or anyone he found outnumbered.<BR>
	Alone Don walks from fishing.  Steven and his friend they stop him.<BR>
	They took his hat and they taunt him,  Pimp-slap him with a newspaper.  <BR>
	Don lunged forward with his fish knife, then ran all the way home weeping.  <BR>
	He gave his knife to his father and said "I think I hurt Steve."<BR>
	Oh what a lonely boy....</P>

	<H3>Wynona's Big Brown Beaver</H3>
	<I>Two, three, four....</I><BR>
	<P>
	Wynona's got herself a big brown beaver and she shows it off to all her friends.<BR>
	One day, you know, that beaver tried to leave her, so she caged him up with cyclone fence.<BR>
	Along came Lou with the old baboon, and said "Recognize that smell?"<BR>
	"Smells like seven layers, That beaver eats Taco Bell."<BR>
	<BR>
	Now Rex he was a Texan out of New Orleans and he travelled with the carnival shows.<BR>
	He ran bumper cars, sucked cheap cigars and he candied up his nose.<BR>
	He got wind of the big brown beaver, so he though he'd take himself a peek,<BR>
	But the beaver was quick, and grabbed him by the kiwis.<BR>
	Now he ain't pissed for a week.  (And a half!)<BR>
	<BR>
	Now Wynona took her big brown beaver, and she stuck him up in the air.<BR>
	Said "I sure do love this big brown beaver and I wish I did have a pair."<BR>
	Now the beaver onces slept for seven days, and it gave us all an awful fright.<BR>
	So I tickled his chin and I gave him a pinch, and the bastard tried to bite me.<BR>
	Wynona loved her big brown beaver, and she stroked him all the time.<BR>
	She pricked her finger one day and it occurred to her she might have a porcupine.</P>


	<H3>Southbound Pachyderm</H3>
	<P>Quite a suprise....What an ingenious device.<BR>
	Boredom encompasses my time.  I don't know what I should do.<BR>
	Indulging a moment of your time.  Seldom the breeder of lies.<BR>
	But you won't believe that it's true.<BR>

	They take to the sky.<BR>
	Southbound Pachyderm.<BR>
	<BR>
	Pinholes through cardboard at the Sun,<BR>
	Passing the bucks by one by one., leaving nothing in return.<BR>

	<H3>Year of the Parrot</H3>
	<P>In the year of our Lord....Call it 1994.<BR>
	A fine vintage of mimicry....<BR>
	There are those that take their sound from someone else's Toil.<BR>
	Liking to parrots you see...<BR>
	<BR>
	I've seen the likes of Kate Bush, and Van Morrison.<BR>
	Teaching the parrots to sing.<BR>
	<BR>
	Take a Zepplin riff, and you alter it a bit.<BR>
	And make lots of money....It's called plagiarism.<BR>
	<BR>
	You want some of that cheese, just take a big ol' bite.<BR>
	Careful not to choke on it please.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now here we go, It's called plagiarism.</P>

	He stepped into the darkened space, the air was thick and warm.<BR>

	He slurped it up the left side.  Blew it out the right side.<BR>
	How he ever kept it down, I will never know.<BR>
	<BR>
	Of course I still remember Ol Flouncin' Freddy,<BR>
	We were pumping gas down at El Sobrante Shell.<BR>

	<H3>Over the Electric Grapevine</H3>
	<P>They headed southward from San Francisco, to be with Chuckles and the others.<BR>
	With electric in the air and peroxide in their hair, they looked like golden brothers.<BR>
	They drove a Datsun, an automatic, the radio blaring static,    <BR>
	He made a face into the light and burst out laughing at the sight.<BR>
	The hysteria ensuing would dominate the night.<BR>
	From all the candy, the seats were sticky, as they were drawn into the grapevine.<BR>
	Then "Introduce Yourself" came on as they barreled through the gog.<BR>
	The demon puffing madly on a mentholated log.<BR>
	They were tired, they were sleepy, so they parked behind the Roxy.<BR>
	Adam left to use the phone, so he sat there all alone,<BR>
	When Adam's voice come beaming through on the radio, he started laughing...</P>

	'Cause his tongue was tired and shy.<BR>
	So he laid the money down and he drank up, put the sparkle in his eye.<BR>
	Sittin' down you saw his paunch, so he stood up, <BR>
	And he gazed across the room.     <BR>
	The toxin squeezed the head, so he slipped back.<BR>

	<H3>Delicate Tendrils</H3>
	<P>Now, because you own, you possess, <BR>
	You have something that they can take.<BR>
	You remember how it was when you had nothing,<BR>
	You looked at the ones that had what you wanted and you felt strong in your need, <BR>
	Brave in your limited surroundings, righteous in your desire for something different.<BR>
	Contempuous of those who had exactly what you wanted.<BR>
	You hated them  because they looked weak and slightly scared.<BR>       
	An you circled the waterhole and thought about closing in.<BR>
	Now you have it, you feel weak in your power to keep it.<BR>
	You feel desparate to make them see, that you won't let them take it away.<BR>
	Because it's yours.  You never had to justify yourself and possessions before.<BR>
	"I earned this.  I worked hard for what I got.  I paid my dues.  I deserve this."<BR>
	You say these things to yourself as the animals circle and wait.  <BR>
	Shake your fists at the hyenas. Chase them away from your waterhole.<BR>
	Justifiy.  See them all differently.  Now you see that they all want something. <BR>
	They want exactly what you got.<BR>
<BR>
	Human gets some juice.  Human becomes prey. Human gets scared.<BR>
	You figure out that you have to be hard to keep it yours.  You have to be cruel.<BR>
	You have to kill them off just for looking.  Leave the bodies by the waterhole so the rest will see.  <BR>
	Hang spent bullet cases from fishing line outside of all the windows of your house.<BR>
	Put up signs- 'Please break in.  I would love the oppurtunity to kill you legally."<BR>
	Let the fear turn into desparate anger.  Start seeing the differences in people.<BR>
	They all start looking suspecious.  They...all...want.<BR>
	Out there, someone is always needy.  Always hungry.  Always looking at you.<BR>
	Checking your eyes for weekness.  Zeroing in on the vein on your neck.<BR>
	Because they cicle the waterhole, and close in.</P> 

	<H3>Precipitation </H3>

	<I>Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain....</I><BR>
	<BR>
	There are stories of pleasure, there are stories of pain.<BR>
	But the gods torment me with slabs of rain.             <BR>
	It started on a Thursday and went double fortnight.  <BR>
	And Junior read Stern by the pilot light.                 <BR>
	<BR>
	He ate more cheese, than time allowed.  <BR>
	So we stood him up sharp, we stood him up proud.        <BR>
	And they looked at him funny, but they looked at him twice.     <BR>
	Undressing with the eyeballs, verbal lashing him spice.<BR>
	<BR>
	I speak the truth, I tell no lies.  <BR>
	Been masturbatin', since the forth of July.     <BR>
	Spill the beans, spill 'em all.          <BR>
	The precipitation filled Spring from Fall. <BR>
	<BR>
	He didn't like faxes, he didn't like phones.<BR>
	When he stood among many, he stands alone. <BR>
	He loved his sausage, but shied from greens.<BR>
	Used to spin his little sister in the washin' machine.<BR>
	<BR>
	<I>Reasonably touchable the slices of his earlier days,<BR>
	For he was a superbed child...of the seventies!</I>

	She was known to take a drop or two in the morning.<BR>
	Yesterdays and lazy days the same.<BR>
	With collagen and fingernails and silicon adorning.<BR>
	All the boys, they knew her by name.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now he's a sport and she's a sport and al the world, they love a sport.<BR>
	And if you've got the urge, we got the time.<BR>
	Layin' on her side, it makes her melancholy.<BR>
	She specualtes if now is not the time.<BR>
	<BR>
	Now baby's breath and orchids are a lethal combination.<BR>
	When you get that girl you got to go.<BR>
	And finger pie in April leads to penetration....<BR>
	But June, she's apt to take it kinda slow.<BR>
	<BR>
	He's born in Beverly Hills, but raised in Albuquerque.<BR>
	All the little girls, they thought him fine.<BR>
	But George E. Porge, he'd kissed the girls and felt he'd rather kiss the boys.<BR>

	<H3>El Sobrante Fortnight </H3>
	<P>Brimming with all the hopes and desires of American youth,<BR>
	He set forth as a leader of sorts.<BR>
	Just what sorts it is impossible to say at this time.<BR>
	But he had the imaginary support he needed to venture beyond the <BR>
	Small enviornment he'd come to know as his home town.    <BR>
	<BR>
	Friends thought him foolish and felt free to frequently tell him so.<BR>
	Deep down they all felt envy, Envious that he could muster, where they could not,<BR>
	The courage that was necessary to embark beyond the motion that survival was based <BR>
	Upon the ability to rise at seven a.m. five days a week.<BR>
	<BR>
	He felt joy.  And well he should.  He was a "babe in the woods", <BR>
	and a "kid in a candy store".  All at the same time.<BR>
	The world was his oyster and he planned to cover it with Tabasco, and slurp it<BR>
	Down with his cake hole all within an "El Sobrante fortnight".<BR>
	<BR>
	Definition of an "El Sobrante fortnight" is yet to be determined. <BR>
	But reliable sources say the time to span is somewhere between two weeks and a decade.</P>

	His face reflecting simple joy, but he is not happy, Plaster Boy.<BR>
	"Careful sonny, not too close, Unless you want a lethal dose of hardening...."<BR>
	Patiently waiting for some shade, wishing he could run away.<BR>
	Surpressing any urge to roam, such devotion from a little gnome.<BR>
	I once saw a calico that thought he could fly.<BR>
	And then the lanky Doberman that tinked in my eye.<BR>
	A pacifist by nature, with amble common sense.<BR>
	But if I had my druthers, I'd druther be a fence.<BR>
	Now Granny, she's a good one, she shines me now and then.<BR>
	And come around this springtime, I'm due for some paint again.<BR>
	On keeping granny comfy, I try and earn my keep.<BR>
	I'm just wishing I had some eyelids, so I could get some sleep.</P>

	<P>
	Fellow colleges, distinguished members of the press, ladies and gentlemen <BR>
        I would like to take this opportunity to personally and humbly thank each and every one of you <BR>
        For joining us at this particular event <BR>
        It is my hope that we can utilize this meeting of the minds <BR>
        To successfully convey the essence of our platform to you,<BR>
	A grand and noble audience <BR>
<BR>
        As I look out among the faces, <BR>
	I reflect taking console in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said, <BR>
        "We have nothing to fear but fear itself" <BR>
        Paranoia is a disease unto itself, and may I add, <BR>
	the person standing next to you, <BR>
        May not be who they appear to be, so take precaution. <BR>
        A mind is a terrible thing to waste, this is true <BR>
        Many a young person has fallen prey, to the substances that alter<BR>
        the perspective Of any right thinking individual <BR>
        The Problem with the youth today is, because of their inexperience with the world <BR>
        They cannot attempt to grasp the ideals, set forth by myself and those who preceded me <BR>
        But, as history has shown, they will come around, <BR>
	and embrace our philosophies And become model citizens in their own right,<BR>
        God bless this great nation   </P>

	<H3>Fisticuffs</H3>

	<P>They found James Ambrose dead in his cell <BR>
	A gaping gash in his arm had drained him down to Hell <BR>
	No one knew for sure if Ambrose was his name <BR>
	They called him Yankee Sullivan in early days of fame <BR>
	He'd known the game of fisticuffs had always treated him right <BR>
	But no one knew the men who came and took his life that night <BR>
<BR>
	He'd spent some time in Botany Bay atoning for his sins <BR>
	He fought a bout with Hammer Lane and took a tainted win <BR>
	He was the hero of the Bowery, a prince of lawless times <BR>
	Then was battered by the "Butcherman" in 1849 <BR>
	He knew the game of fisticuffs, he knew the game of might <BR>
<BR>
	But no one knew the men who came and took his life one night <BR>
	He knew the game of fisticuffs <BR>
	Lilly and McCoy were shy of a hundred and forty pounds <BR>
	In 1842 they went a hundred and eighteen rounds <BR>
	They begged McCoy to cash it in, he said that he would not <BR>
	Got up and fought one more round then died right on the spot <BR>

	<H3>Golden Boy</H3>
	<P>He was a mighty golden boy, as gold as ever seen <BR>
	But when he stepped up to the podium, you could tell that boy was mean <BR>
	His arms was made of nickel, and his forehead made of wood <BR>
	An affidavit from the principal says,"This boy just ain't no good" <BR>
	He stood before the union, and he made a solemn oath <BR>
	Uphold the purity of his creed, the others he would toast <BR>
	He worked nights at the liquor mart, and he drank to pad his pay <BR>
	When he caught him liftin¹ 40's, he shot a boy last May <BR>
	His momma asked why? <BR>
	His lawyer in the courtroom, made a noble plea <BR>

	<H3>Restin' Bones</H3>

<P>	Came up on a worried man, asked him if he had a light <BR>
	He reached on down, dug in his shoe, figured in his sock he might <BR>
	He asked if he could come and join, at what we was partakin' in <BR>
	I says,"Ol' soul if you got a match, you also got yourself a friend" <BR>
<BR>
	The smoke drew hard but laid in good, the neon gave us extra shine <BR>
	We passed around a flask of Knockando, and a half litre bottle of wine <BR>
	The worried man dropped down to his knees, and let out with a somber groan <BR>
	He looked up to me and when I asked, he said,"I'm just restin' my bones" <BR>
<BR>
	I looked down at him, and him up at me, then a smile rose above his chin <BR>
	He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me down, said,"Listen to me now my friend" <BR>
	When I was your age I did it all, more than many men could do <BR>
	now my possessions are the ones I wear on my back, and this lighter I keep in my shoe <BR>
	 That's why I'm restin' my bones <BR>
<BR>
	I'm restin' my bones for the times I fell, fell and hit myself on the ground <BR>
	Restin' my bones for the loneliness, of being the only genius around <BR>
	I'm restin' my bones for prosperity, in hopes that it'll do me some good <BR>
	I'm restin' bones from amphetamines, see they turned teeth to balsa wood <BR>
	I'm restin' bones for Johnny Cash, because for me and mine he's wearin' black <BR>
	I'll be restin' my bones for Elvis, I seen him last week at the track <BR>
	If I'm restin' bones and you come along, just try and tippy toe on by <BR>
	Cause when I'm restin' bones I hope to sleep, and maybe slip away and die   <BR>

<PRE>

In 1986, the University of Californa at Davis
saw two of its all-time brightest stars, 
Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Dr. Arnie Abesacraben.
Dr. Mephisto worked hard towards his thesis - his goal 
was to genetically duplicate the DNA structure of Asparagus, 
so that all Asparagus would grow to the same girth and length, 
Giving Asparagus a much more pleasent presentation in the world's 
supermarkter vegetable bins.  

Dr. Abesacraben's goal was to genetically create the greatest 
musical entertainer the world had ever seen. 
Dr. Abesacraben knew that if he could assemble the right elements, 
he could theoretically build a DNA structure that would ensure 
his creation had talent far surpassing the average individual.

At the time, one subject of urban myth was the story that 
Michael Jackson - in an effort to maintain his youthful look and 
feminie vocal characteristics - had his testicles surgically removed, 
thereby making him a modern-day castrato.  

If such a rumor were true, Michael Jackson more that likely would have 
had some of his semen preserved before the surgery, to ensure his the 
future of his name and lineage.  

Word came back to Dr. Abesacraben of a secret cold storage locker
deep within the bowels of the UCLA research center, that not only 
contained four containers of frozen semen, but also held a pair of 
testicles, each was labeled with the name "Jack Michaelson".

I once heard a noise, <BR>
In the night the most sensual voice.<BR>
Song of love from a eight year-old boy, <BR>
Stuck in my head. <BR>
And this is what he said:<BR>
<BR>
I am gopher boy!<BR>
Pondering reality!<BR>
I am gopher boy!<BR>
Who will buy my raspberries?<BR>

<PRE>
This had to be the seed of the king of pop!
Dr. Abesacraben was able to use his charm and and chissled Greek
feature to woo a young lab technician by the name of Jennifer, who of 
course happened to have the proper access needed to obtain a small vial 
of the precious semen.  

The search for the egg was a short one - Dr. Mephisto simply ran an ad 
in the classified section of an airline music magazine.  The ad read: 
"Wanted: unfertilized human eggs for genetic experiment.  Donors must 
have musical background."  With a pleathera of young, eager wanna-be 
music starlets willing to sell their eggs, the two doctors - after
rigorous 
auditioning - picked... and purchased.  

Dr. Abesacraben felt that it would be far less complicated legally if the 
fetus were brought to term in the womb of a non-human.  He had long since 
secured the services of the University volleyball mascot, a llama by the
name of "Missy".  
When the baby was ready, the child via cesarean.  It was a healthy baby 
boy; he was named Kevin.

Kevin was a beautiful child.  Dr. Abesacraben saw to it that Kevin was
trained by the best in all aspects of performing.  His voice was golden, and had a
sweetness to it that most males lacked.  He moved with grace, and was able to
moonwalk by the time he was three.  As Kevin grew in his talent, Dr. Abesacraben
started noticing odd developments in his physical state.  When Kevin lost his baby 
teeth, his secondaries came in with a vengance! They were at least twice
the size of a normal adult's, and the two in front stuck nearly straight out.  Also
as Kevin reached his eighth year, he was the same as the was when he was four.  To
top it off, he was growing hair all over and his penis was enormous, even by adult
standards. 
It also dawned on the doctor that even trough all the years of hearing Kevin sing, 
he rarely spoke, often choosing to communicate with various grunt and gurgles.

Others were noticing the changes in Kevin.  Children began to tease him - to call him "Gopher Boy".  
One day a bully by the name of "Big Roy" started throwing bananas at him.  
Soon a crowd of kids were all throwing bananas.  
Suddenly, in a fury, Kevin rushed at Big Roy and bit three finger fingers off on his left hand.  
Kevin was taken away and placed in the custody of the state.  
Dr. Abesacraben's actions were found out, but because there was no legislation 
concerning the genetic instruction of a human being, no criminal charges were brought forth.  
The medical association's board of ethics stripped him of all his creditials, and his reputation was ruined.  
In fact, his name became to synonmous with failure, that for years to come, 
Medical students around the world were known to say in times of mishaps, 
"Damn, I feel just like Abesacraben".  

Dr. Mephisto immediately began procedings to adopt little Kevin.  
Being a noted scientist and the creator of the cloned Asparagus, 
it wasn't long before the two were legally united as father and son.  
They moved to Colorado where they live in relative obscurity.  
Kevin is still a boy of few spoken words, sticking mainly to his grunts and gurgles.  
But on occasion, if you listen closely, 
you can hear his sweet golden signing voice ring out into the night over the town of South Park:

	<H3><A NAME="buckethead">The Ballad of Buckethead</A></H3>
	"Who's this guitar-playing sonsa bitch?", is a question common asked.  <BR>
	On his head a bucket of chicken bones, on his face a plaster mask.<BR>
	He's the bastard son of a preacher man, on the town he left a stain.<BR>
	They made him live in a chicken house to try to and hide the shame. <BR>
	<BR>
	<EM>He was born in a coop, raised in a cage.  Children fear him, critics rage.  <BR>
	He's half alive, he's half dead.  Folks just call him Buckethead.  </EM><BR>	
	<BR>
	Farmers would torment him as he snuggled with the hens.<BR>
	They'd hose him down with water, and steal his little friends.<BR>
	Now late at night he'd sneak off to the graveyard all alone, <BR>
	And play a soapbox guitar to the faces made of stone.  <BR>
	<BR>
	Buckethead found his freedom at the age of 17, 	<BR>
	when he burned the chicked house down with a quart of gasoline.<BR>
	He did puppet shows on corners and bought a real guitar,<BR>
	And with the help of Colonel Sanders, he's bound to be a star.<BR>
	<BR>
	<EM>He was born in a coop, raised in a cage.  Children fear him, critics rage.  <BR>
	He's half alive, he's half dead.  Folks just call him Buckethead.  </EM><BR>
