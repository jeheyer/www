Les Claypool explains the departure of Tim Alexander from Primus:

"It something that's been coming for a long time; something
we've talked about.  It was getting to the point where none
of use were very happy...and a lot of it stemmed from Herb's
discontent.  Creatively, me and Larry have always clicked, and
Herb's just kind of did his thing...And it worked out marvelously,
but it was getting to the point where he wasn't very happy on stage.
It was getting to the point where the band was going to break up
simply because the energy level was too low.  I think most of all
Herb wanted to do other things, and when I talked to him he
seemed almost relieved.  I think He had been thinking about leaving
the band for a while, and this was just the way it happenend.  It
was definately mutual, it's just that we made the nudge.
