Here's what to:

1. Get you computer in DOS mode, either by restarting in DOS or using a
DOS boot disk.

2. Go to your CD-ROM drive (D: on most systems), and type "dir".  If you
get a Bunch of Files, you're OK.  This should work for any ATAPI CD-ROM,
I'm not too sure about NEC and Toshibas though.

3. Use the XCOPY command to copy all the CD-ROM data to your hard drive:
	XCOPY D:\*.* C:\TALES /S 
This command assumed D: was your CD-ROM drive and you wanted to copy all
the stuff on the CD to C:\TALES

4. Use the same command for the hidden DATA/ directory:
	XCOPY D:\DATA\*.* C:\TALES\DATA\ /S

5. Run the install program off your hard drive; it should install OK.

6. Run Tales From the Punchbowl!  When it asks you get the error message
and it asks you for the DXR file, don't freak!  Just type in something
like C:\TALES\DATA\STARTUP.DXR and everything should be cool.

I have a Mitsumi 12x, and now can run the CD under Windows 95 and
Windows NT 4.0.  The only drawback is that I have to change my res. to 
640x480 (I usually run 1280x1024), but thanks to the dynamic display
settings it's not too cumbersome.  If you have questions, just send me
an e-mail.
