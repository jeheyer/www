ION has a web site (http://www.ionmusic.com), with a tech support section, 
however they seem rather unwilling to refund the CDs when that appears to be 
the only solution.  I tried using an older version of Windows 95 with a Hitachi 
ATAPI CD-ROM drive, and it erased it from my BIOS.  So, the best solution may be 
to write (not e-mail) ION and ask them for a new CD:



You may find it helpful to read or include this e-mail I got 
from Hitachi's CD-ROM tech support:

Here is the information we have on Enhanced CD's:
     
     According to EMI Records, some current Enhanced CD-ROM's were 
     manufactured using the Pre-Gap format.  Most of those CD-ROM titles 
     will perform correctly if the CD-ROM drive is using real mode (DOS) 
     drivers, which means that they will work fine in Windows 3.1 or 3.11. 
     The version of Windows 95 that you get when you purchase a new 
     computer does not include support for Pre-Gap formatted Enhanced 
     CD-ROM's, although some earlier versions of Windows 95 drivers (which 
     is what you get when you buy 95 at the store) will allow them to play. 
     95 does include support for CD-ROM discs using the newer Blue Book 
     format (multi-session), such as the Microsoft Music Sampler. If your 
     CD-ROM disc does not play properly in your CD-ROM drive, it is 
     probably a Pre-Gap CD.  You should contact the publisher of the CD-ROM 
     and ask for an updated version of the CD-ROM that conforms to the new 
     Blue Book format.
     
     If there is anything else that I can help you with, let me know.
