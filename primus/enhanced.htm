<P>In case you haven't heard, the <U>Tales From the Punchbowl: Enhaced CD</U> 
really sucks.  In addition to being a regualr audio CD, it is an interactive CD-ROM that 
let you experince unique animation to go along with each song.  The problem with the 
Enhaced CD is that it is very demanding in terms of hardware, and very picky on what 
drivers it runs under.  This list has been set up to help you correct any problems you
 might be having.   If you have a problem that isn't listed here, or have a question 
about any of the information about this page, 
<A HREF="mailto:primus@jfive.com?subject=Enhanced CD">mail</A> me.</P>

<NOTE CLASS=warning><H3><BLINK>Warning!</BLINK></H3> <P><I><B>Before buying the Enhanced CD, 
make sure you're not planning on using any <U>ATAPI</U> CD-ROM Drive under Windows 95.  
Also, the CD-ROM will not run on Windows 3.1 for most Toshiba and NEC drives.</B></I></NOTE></P>

<A NAME="form"><H2>Please Help!</H2></A>
<P>In order to prevent people from buying incompatible CDs, I'm trying to build a list 
of CD-ROM drives and whether or not they work.  If you could take the time to complete this form, 
it would be greatly appreciated!</P>

<P><B>Problem:</B> When I go to run the CD, it behaves only as an audio CD, and I can't see INSTALL.EXE or any of the files.</P>
<P><I>The Enhanced CD was written in a format that the newer ATAPI CD-ROMs can't 
understand.  There are no drivers that will let you correct this.  There are however, 
a few solutions:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Use A Different Computer (Macintoshes Work Very Well)
<LI>Buy Another CD-ROM Drive that is Compatible
<LI>If you're on a Network, use someone else's CD-ROM drive
<LI>Use DOS Mode to <A HREF="info/xcopy.txt">Copy the CD contents</A> (160 MB) to the Hard Drive
<LI>Ask <A HREF="http://www.ionmusic.com">ION</A> for <A HREF="info/ion.txt">another CD-ROM</A> Disk
</UL>

<P><B>Problem:</B> I get a message about the display colors being incorrect.</P>
<P><I>You must run the CD-ROM in 256 colors mode.  In Windows 95, go to control panel 
and double-click on <B>display</B>.  Click on the <B>settings</B> tab and change the <B>color palette</B> box to 256 color.  In Windows 3.1, go to control panel and double-click on the icon for your display driver.  If you don't have one, double-click on 
<B>Windows Setup</B> in the <B>Main</B> group, and from the <B>Options</B> menu, select <B>Change system settings</B>.  Change the <B>Display</B> box to a mode that will display 256 colors (i.e. 640x480x256).  In Macintosh, select <B>Monitors</B> under co
ntrol panel, and change the setting.</I></P>   
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<P><B>Problem:</B> I get a message saying "can't initialize helm".</P>
<P><I>As far as we can tell, this has something to do with the display drivers being used. Make sure you are running in 640x480, 256 colors mode.  If you already are, try using a different driver for that same resolution if possible.</I></P>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<P><B>Problem:</B>  The program appears as a small rectangle in the middle of the screen with black around it.</P>
<P><I>The CD is designed to run in the 640x480 resolution.  Resize your screen to this resolution and try it again.</I></P>

<P>Below are various CD-ROM models and their compatibility with Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 for 
using the Enhanced CD.</P> 
<P>Windows NT users should assume the result for Windows 95 will be the same as NT 4.0, and likewise 
the result for Windows 3.1 should be the same for NT 3.5 / 3.51. <EM><B>These result come in from anonymous 
people, so there's no guarantee they're correct.</B></EM></P>
