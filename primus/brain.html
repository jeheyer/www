<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">All About Brain</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Just in case you haven't heard, Brian "Brain" Mantia is Primus's new drummer, replacing Tim "Herb"
Alexander.  Brain became Primus's drummer approximately August 20th, 1996 (a mere three weeks after Tim 
and Primus split) by finding the golden drumhead.  No, actually he didn't find a golden drumhead, he was chosen 
by Les and Ler.  Brain will bring a new feel to Primus.  Unlike Tim, Brain is a close friend of Les and Ler, 
and will therefore be more involved in Primus's writing that Tim was.  Brain is also a "high-energy, hard-hitting 
drummer".  As Les himself says, <I>"Now that we have...Brain, there's an excitement in the band that hasn't been there 
<U>ever</U>!"</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The combination of Brain and Primus is nothing new.  In addition to touring with Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel  
last fall (which featured a few special guest appearences by <A HREF="lalonde.htm">Ler</A>), 
Brain was actually choosen as Primus's drummer about seven years ago. Apparently, 
Brain broke his foot in some kind of skateboarding accident, and was replaced by Tim Alexander.
Also, if you look in the credits on the inside of <A HREF="disco.htm#cheese"><EM>Sailing the Seas of Cheese</EM></A>, you'll 
notice that Brain is listed among the Bastardos drummers.  Of course, Brain was also a member of 
the elite "Fart Sandwich Posse" (Check out the inside cover of <A HREF="disco.htm#friz"><EM>Frizzle Fry</EM></A>).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Prior to joining Primus last August, Brain was the drummer for the Limbomaniacs, which 
once featured Mark "<A HREF="http://www.mirv.com" TARGET="_parent">M.I.R.V.</A>" Haggard.  Brain also worked 
with MIRV on 1993's <EM>Cosmodrome</EM> -which was produced by <A HREF="claypool.htm">Les Claypool</A>- and a 
did a little drumming on the band's latest release, <EM>Feeding Time on Monkey Island</EM>. 
Brain also used to drum for the Bill Laswell sideproject Praxis, whose members included Buckethead, Bernie Worell, and 
"Bootsy" Collins on Bass.  Last year, Brain, Buckethead, and former Limbomaniacs guitarist Pete S. got together 
for a sideproject called Giant Robot, and Brain played drums for Godflesh on the summer '96 tour in addition to doing some 
work on their latest album.  Brain has also 
worked with Tom Waits, Jon Hassell, and once did a little ditty with Les and Joe Gore (P.J. Harvey) called <EM>GoreLesBrain</EM>. 
Also of note, Brain is a big <A HREF="http://www.5000volt.com/pantera/">Pantera</A>
fan.</FONT></P>
