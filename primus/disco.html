	<td><h2 id="suck">Suck on This</h2>
	<p><b>Suck on This</b> was recorded in February 1989 in 
	Berkeley Square, CA.  It featured such memorable quotes as "Herb the Ginseng Drummer", "Larry You're 
	a Bastard", and "We're Primus, we Suck".  Of course, it also had an awesome version of Tommy 
	the Cat with one of Les's best solos. With the exception of "The Heckler", all the songs appeared on other Primus albums or soundtracks.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="friz">Frizzle Fry</h2>
	<p>After selling Suck on This (with some success) to 
	local record stores, Primus got on the Caroline records label and recorded their first studio album.  
	<B>Frizzle Fry</B> had 13 tracks, including Primus's first hit <EM>John the Fisherman</EM>.  With 
	other trash/metal/funk songs as <EM>Pudding Time</EM>, <EM>Too Many Puppies</EM>, and <EM>To Defy the Laws of Tradition</EM>, 
	many fans consider this their favorite album.  In case you're wondering what the title's about, 
	Claypool was doing a <U>lot</U> of acid at the time.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="cheese">Sailing the Seas of Cheese</h2>
	<p>After leaving Caroline, Primus talked with several record companies 
	before finding Interscope.  <B>Sailing the Seas of Cheese</B> dealt with Frizzle Fry's success and the soul-searching that 
	followed it.  It is considered the most angry and anarchistic album, and is typically the most critically aclaimed with masterful 
	bass work on the hits <EM>Jerry was a Racecar Driver</EM> and <EM>Tommy the Cat</EM> and the unusual rhythms of <EM>Eleven</EM> 
	and <EM>Those Damn Blue-Collar Tweekers</EM>, which became classic songs with fans.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="misc">Miscellanous Debris</h2>
	<p>In 1992, Primus toured mostly but took enough time 
	to do a small EP of covers. <B>Miscellaneous Debris</B> was the first album to candidly show Claypool's interest 
	in the Residents, as <EM>Sinister Exaggerator</EM> was featured.  The album also included XTC's 
	<EM>Making Plans for Nigel</EM>, Pink Floyd's <EM>Have a Cigar</EM>, and two other songs.  </p></td>

	<td><A HREF="images/pork_cov.jpg"><IMG SRC="images/sm_pork.jpg" ALT="Pork Soda Album Cover Thumbnail"></A></td>
	<td><h2 id="pork">Pork Soda</h2>
	<p>Shocking the music industry by premeiring at number 8 on the charts, 1993's <B>Pork Soda</B> nearly cast Primus into 
	mainstream popularity with the top ten hit <EM>My Name is Mud</EM>, which drew heavy play both 
	on radio and MTV.  Ironically, the title "Pork Soda" symbolized Primus's music as something disgusting no one wanted.  Fans also enjoyed <EM>DMV</EM>, 
	<EM>Nature Boy</EM>, <EM>Welcome to this World</EM>, <EM>Mr. Krinkle</EM>, and of course the legendary <EM>Hamburger Train</EM> (a 9 minute 
	instrumental).  </p></td>

	<p>In 1994, Primus took a break from each other to work on 
	side projects.  Les Claypool's sideproject was Sausage, and their album was <B>Riddles Are Abound Tonight</B>.
	More jazzy and experimental than Primus, the <A HREF="videos.html#riddles">video</A> for the title track was one of the most bizarre in history, 
	and inspired Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head) to create the Great Cornholio.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="punchbowl">Tales from the Punchbowl</h2>
	<p>Despite the grammy-nominated hit <EM>Wynona's Big Brown Beaver</EM>, 
	<B>Tales From the Punchbowl</B> is considered by many to be the weakest Primus album.  The album continues 
	on many of the ideas from Seas of Cheese and Pork Soda, but still manages to sound different.  It was the first 
	ablum where Ler's parts took the melody rather than Les, and like Pork Soda, premeired at number 8.  </p></td>

	<td><h2 id="highball">Highball with the Devil</h2>
	<p>Shortly following the change of drummers in Summer 1996 (Tim left 
	and Brain joined), Les Claypool released his first solo album, called <B>Highball with the Devil</B>.  Although Les 
	plays bass, guitar and even drums for most of the album, he is helped out by Jay Lane, MIRV, and Joe Gore on a few 
	tracks.  The album received no radio play and produced no videos, but nonetheless was the number 3 college radio 
	alternative Album that year.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="brown">Brown Album</h2>
	<p>With Brain behind the set, <B>Brown Album</B> marked the 
	beginning of a new era for Primus.  Blessed with a new energy, Primus explored its macabre side with 
	such eerily delightful songs as <EM>Fisticuffs</EM>, <EM>Over the Falls</EM>, and <EM>Kalamazoo</EM>.  The album also touched on Primus's earlier 
	work with such songs as the new foot-stoppin' favorite <EM>Puddin' Taine</EM> and the mood-shifting 
	<EM>Return of Sathington Willoby</EM>.  Despite the abscence of a first hit single, the album still 
	premeired at number 21 on the charts and the band played the HORDE festival in the summer.</p></td>

	<td><h2 id="rhino">RhinoPlasty</h2>
	<p>Despite touring heavily in the year 
	following Brown, the band somehow managed to find the time to record <B>Rhinoplasty</B>, the 
	1998 followup to Miscellaneous Debris.  Taking its name from the <EM>South Park</EM> cartoon, the EP included 
	once again covers of Peter Gabriel and XTC, along ones by with the Police, Stanley Clarke, and Metallica, plus two 
	live tracks from the last <EM>New Year's Freakout</EM>.  While the album was released in May in Europe, the US version 
	was delayed until August so an Enhanced CD-ROM could be completed.  </p></td>

	<td><h2 id="antipop">AntiPop</h2>
	<p>Right after working on side projects with Buckethead and Tom Waits, the band went 
	back to the studio in the summer of '99 to record <B>AntiPop</B>, their 9th 
	album.  Stylistically, Primus decided to do a harder, more fan-oriented album, 
	in the style of <A HREF="#friz">Frizzle Fry</A>.  Several friends 
	such as Tom Morello, Fred Durst, and Stewart Copeland produced songs, and the 
	recording of Oz Fritz and mixing of Toby Wright made for a cleaner sound than before.  
	Favorites include <EM>Electric Uncle Sam</EM>, <EM>Lacquerhead</EM>, 
	<EM>Dirty Drowning Man</EM>, and the 8 minute <EM>Eclectric Electric</EM>.</p></td>
