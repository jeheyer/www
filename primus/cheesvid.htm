<TD><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The <B>Cheesy Home Video</B> is a must for any true bastard.  It's pretty tough 
to find, but if you keep bothering record store people you'll get it eventually.  Although the 
video centers on an El Bastardo fishing trip (with Bob C Cock - the C is for Cock! - as a special guest), the video 
shows the band on and off stage in their European tour of 1992 and on their tour with Anthrax and Public Enemy.  Oh, it also has the 
complete <A HREF="videos.htm">videos</A> for <EM>John the Fisherman</EM>, <EM>Jerry was a Racecar Driver</EM>, and 
<EM>Tommy the Cat</EM>.</FONT></P></TD>

Ler caught a Tuna, Herb got bait down his pants.  It turned out to be a rather 
disappointing fishing trip, but the "bum tickler" made things worthwhile.</TD>
