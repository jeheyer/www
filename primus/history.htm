<H1><TT>Personal Primus Story</TT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I first saw Primus in <I>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey</I> in 1992. I though
they were the worst band I had ever heard. I didn't understand what was
going on: There was this skinny, strange looking guy playing some instrument
really hard, but I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be metal or
what. I guessed there were only two other people in the band: a guitarist
of some kind and a drummer. I dismissed them as some sort of freak-metal
Anthrax wanna-bes, and didn't even pay attention to what their name was.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">About a year later, in late 1993, I was joining a CD club with one of those 8 for
1 deals. I had got all the stuff I really wanted and still had two selections
left. I saw there was this band called Primus with an album called <I>Pork
Soda</I> that I think I had heard a few people at school talking about.
The cover looked interesting, so I figured I had nothing to loose. For
my other selection, I was too lazy to scan through the rest of the catalog,
so I got <I>Sailing the Seas of Cheese</I>. When my CDs came a few weeks
later, I popped in Pork Soda first out of curiosity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. All I really knew was that it was
different from anything I'd heard before. I still couldn't figure out where
the instruments were, but there was this song called <I>DMV</I> which was
the most unbelievable thing I had ever heard. The main melody --I still
couldn't understand who was playing it-- was unbelievable, and the drummer
was pounding away on the tom-toms, which was very different from anything
I had heard in the recent years. There were some other really good songs
on the album: <I>Nature Boy</I>, <I>Welcome to This World</I>, <I>My Name
is Mud</I>, and then this awesome 8 minute instrumental called <I>Hamburger
Train</I>. Although I was in total awe of what I had just heard, I still
didn't know if it was good or what. There were lots of these little two-minute
instrumentals on the album, which really broke it up in little sections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">It was time to hear Seas of Cheese, so I popped it in. After this little
song with what I think was a cello, there was this ominous intro and then
this really hard-stomping song called <I>Here Come the Bastards</I>. There
was <I>Sergeant Baker</I>, with this really cool groove and then this drifty
song called <I>American Life</I>. The fifth song on the album was called
<I>Jerry Was a Racecar Driver</I>, and it was the best song I had ever
heard. About this time, I took a look in the cover at the credits. As I
listened to the song, I still wasn't sure what was going on with the instruments.
To me, it sounded like there was a solo and rhythm guitar, along with a
bass and drums. But when I looked in the credits, I saw there were only
three people in the band: a bassist/singer, a guitarist, and a drummer.
And then it hit me:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">He was doing the whole thing by himself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">What I though was rhythm guitar was in fact a bass jumping all over
the scale. And he was singing on top of it! I couldn't figure out how he
did it, because I had never heard anything even close to that done on a
bass. This was this weird, off-tempo song called <I>Eleven</I>, which the
singer --Les Claypool was his name-- shouted "I Just Can't Seem to Fit
Into Society!" How true, I thought. Despite the ideal that grunge was rebellious, this music was different, and so much
better than almost anything that had been going on in the last three years.
Later, there was <I>Tommy the Cat</I>, the very song which had nearly made
me puke a year earlier. When I listened to the bass, it just blew me away.
I couldn't believe any human could play that fast. I thought how weird
it was that although the bass was the lead instrument, the guitar still
soloed. There was this really great song called <I>Those Damn Blue-Collared
Tweekers</I> towards the end of the CD, followed by this weird song called
<I>Fish On</I> that started really slow and then turned into a Jam.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Shortly thereafter, I bought <I>Miscellaneous Debris</I> and after finding
<I>Frizzle Fry</I> in a Chicago record store a few months later, Primus
became my favorite band. In 1995, I bought <I>Tales From the Punchbowl</I>
the day it came out, and found <I>Riddles Are Abound Tonight</I> used in
New Jersey. I finally found <I>Suck on This</I> in a Pittsburgh record
store last summer, and finally got caught up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Primus has been my favorite band for over 3 years now, but I still don't
know why. Maybe it's because they have a great bass player and fun lyrics:
something lacking in most music today. I still don't know quite how to
describe Primus, other than simply, "They're Just Different."</FONT></P>
