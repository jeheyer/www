	<H3><TT>Primus on Haitus</TT></H3>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">With Brain leaving the band, Primus is currently in limbo, but has 
	not broken up.  Tim Alexander could possibly return, but currently no one really knows Ler's interest with the band.  
	Les is very happy again working with Jay Lane and Todd Huth on his "Frog Brigade" project, so that remains his
	immediate focus.  </FONT></P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Once again, Primus has managed
	to crack the top 50 best selling albums.  AntiPop ranked number 44 last
	week, not bad considering no singles/videos/major promos, etc.  Brown 
	was 42, Pork Soda and Punchbowl both hit the top 10.  </FONT></P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">More significantly, AntiPop was number 5
	among new releases, outselling Big Bad Voodoo Daddy among others.

	<H3><TT>New Album Reviewed</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">A few bastards have been lucky enough to get an advance copy of the album, and 
	overall, the reviews are good.  Unfortunately, Brain's playing leaves a lot to be desired 
	and Ler does not quite outdo his work on Punchbowl.  Overall, the most exciting feature is 
	simply the energy of a "new" Primus.  The album features such songs as 
	<I>Duchess and the Proverbial Mind Spread</I> and <I>Shake Hands with Beef</I>.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Release Date Delayed?</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">It appears the new album will be released July 1st.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Happy Birthday Cage</TT></H3>

	<H3><TT>Primus signs on for H.O.R.D.E.</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">After doing a European tour in late June/early July, Primus will return to the U.S.
	to do the H.O.R.D.E. festival.  The festival begins July 12th in Seattle, and ends up on 
	the east coast in late August - no specific dates have been announced yet.  The festival 
	will also feature Neil Young, Widespread Panic, and Morphine with Beck and Blues Traveler 
	at a few dates.</FONT></P>
	<H3><TT>New Album</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I case you didn't know, the new album is scheduled for a June 17th release, although there 
	are rumors it won't be out until July 1st.  The title is expected to be "The Brown Album", although 
	it's not clear if that's the real title or just a handle for a self-titled album.  Judging from 
	Primus concert April 12th in Petaluma, the album will feature a mix of 4 string, 6 string, and upright 
	bass work.  It will be best described as "Seas of Cheese meets Holy Mackerel."</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>New Album set for June 17th Release</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Primus's next album (untitled as of yet) will be released June 17th.  Musically,
	the album will be tighter and more oriented towards work on Frizzle Fry and Seas of Cheese 
	than Tales From the Punchbowl.  Lyrically, the characters will be "more rooted in reality, but 
	still weird".  Primus will be doing a European tour at the end of June, and will then return 
	to the U.S. for a tour in July.</FONT></P>
	<H3><TT>Primus Plays Benefit Concerts</TT></H3>

	<H3><TT>Primus Play Freak Out</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Primus finished 1996 by hosting the 2nd annual <B>New Year's Freak Out</B>, 
	and Fans for the first time got to see the "New Primus" play together.  Reviews for Brain 
	on drums were positve, although Brain's playing was somewhat conservative.  Primus played two new 
	songs in addition to all the favorites.  The Breeders (aka The Amps) and Protein openend.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>New Album Due in May</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Primus headed back into the studio last month to begin recording a new album.  The new album 
	(untitled as of yet) will be out in May, almost two years after the Primus's last release, <EM>Tales 
	From the Punchbowl</EM>.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Love Those Mackerel</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The release of <EM>Highball With the Devil</EM> has been met with unprecedented enthusiasm and amazement.  Basically everyone agrees that the album is even better than we had hoped.  I can tell you personnally <EM>Highball</EM> is about ten times better than a certain other album that was released on the 27th.  Hmmmmmm....who could that be?  Also, reports from the Mackerel concerts say the album sounds even better played live.  Make sure you don't miss the Mackerel on tour.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>I'm Only Happy When it Brains</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">New Primus drummer Brian "Brain" Mantia has been filling in for Jay Lane on the Mackerel's tour, and has left the audience excited about his future with Primus. People have described him as "the hardest hitting drummer I've ever seen" and "a perfect addition to Primus".  Brain will start recording with Les and Ler in December.</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The search for a drummer to replace Herb has ended!  His name is Brian "Brain" Mantia, and no one has ever heard of him!

	<H3><TT>Don't Believe the Hype!</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">As expected, the combination of Herb's split and Les's new solo album have led to rumors Primus is breaking up.  In the words of Public Enemy- <EM>Don't Believe the Hype!</EM> A new drummer will be announced shortly and Primus will begin recording the next album by the end of the year.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Herb <EM>Fired?</EM></TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">As it turns out, Tim Alexander didn't just "walk out" of Primus as previously thought.  It was more Les's decision that the band wanted to go different ways and another drummer would be better for the band.</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Tim "Herb" Alexander and Primus split!</TT></H3>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Unfortunately, we have to begin this section with news that isn't so great.  Tim "Herb" Alexander -affectionately known as "Herb the Ginseng Drummer"- has parted ways with Primus.  Apparently, "creative differences" surfaced during the Spring '96 tour, and it was decided that this was the best thing to do.  We need not fear.  Primus will still continue and a replacement will be announced soon.  While several people have (sarcastically) suggested former Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, the favorite choice is Jay Lane.  For those of you not familiar with Jay, he is the original drummer of Primus -back when they were still called Primate.  He was recently drummer for the Charlie Hunter Trio, and is currently touring with Bob Weir's band Ratdog.  He has worked with Les both on the 1994 side project "Sausage", and also plays on Les's upcoming solo album.   Even if Jay isn't the choice, Primus will continue to suck.  According to Les, Primus will start recording with the new drummer in December, and as far as I know, the release of a live Prius album is scheduled for release early next year. 

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><I>Note:</I> An official statement about Tim's leaving is available <A HREF="http://www.ram.org/music/primus/misc/timquits.html" TARGET="_parent">here</A>.</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Les Claypool's first solo project, <I>Highball with the Devil</I>, will be released August 27th!</FONT></P>

	<H3><TT>Les is a father</TT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">As horrible as it is to imagine, Les Claypool is now a father.  His son Cage was born in May.</FONT></P>
