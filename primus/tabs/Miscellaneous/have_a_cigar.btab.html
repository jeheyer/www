*=slowly slide into the 7th fret

Well, that's basically the cool riff. I didn't tab the rest of the
song because I didn't bother to learn the rest of the song.  I know
that like for the 3rd fret on the A string, you could just use the 8th
fret on the E string, but it doesn't sound as good.

MAIN

Throughout the whole song he uses his six string fretless and he has a
low B string so you gotta downtune your bass to a D. The whole song
has the E downtuned too.

At 20 seconds into the song he goes:

d -2--4----------------4-  go to MAIN
a ---------3------3------

(play these notes long and "sticky" cause this is played on his
fretless)

2:55 minutes at the guitar solo start:

It's just random jumps between:

LOW d-0 and HIGH d-2

and from there you can put together the rest of the song.
