You can play it with out a tremolo, but I REALLY recomend that you use
one. Anyway, you just sway the tremolo back and forth, non-stop.  You
hammer the the notes with your left hand.  On the open E's, grab the
string with your thumb, and pull it down HARD.  Then, bend your
tremolo WAY down--as low as it will go to get a real raunchy sound.
Les also put some kind of effects behind it, but you don't really need
that either.
