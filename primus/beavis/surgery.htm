<FONT SIZE=-1>Intro and interview transcription by Paul Semel<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their guitarists have sheepish smiles, their singers have big noses, but Rush and Primus
have more in common than good looks. Both trios mix complex rhythmic structures, streaming
guitars, and literate lyrics, and all six members are big Three Stooges Fans - as immortalized both
in the new Primus tune, "Poetry and Prose," recorded for The Beavis & Butt-head Experience
(Geffen) and the liner notes of Rush's new album Counterparts (Anthem/Atlantic). But beyond
that, beyond the mutual respect, friendship, and the endless jams we'll never hear, are the
completely opposite misconceptions they both suffer:<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primus are thought of as a bunch of cartoonish meatballs, while Rush is considered to be a
group of mind-blowing instrumental perfectionists, when both could be said of either band.
Similarly, Primus' Les Claypool is one of the most unusual and original bassists ever - he could
eventually be as influential a bassist as Rush's percussion master Neil Peart is a drummer - yet
Rush's recent shows have included giant dancing rabbits. So what happens when you get Les
Claypool and his Rush counterpart Geddy Lee together?<P>


<BR><B>LES:</B> So what do you think of us? When we came to do your tour, the last time, I would
assume you got demo tapes and had to pick through a few different things, and all of a sudden
here come three guys ... [laughs] I mean, there are a lot of parallels between us and you guys,
and a lot of differences. Did you ever think we were ripping you off or anything? [laughs] 
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> No, no ... 
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> When you heard the "YYZ" intro to "Suck on This" it didn't ...
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> I thought it was great. There aren't too many bands that have thrown bits of our
stuff into their songs. Whether it's for musical purposes or humorous purposes you're never quite
sure. Someone at the record company had sent us a copy of _Sailing the Seas of Cheese_
[Interscope], and when I first heard it, there was something that reminded me of this band from
Canada called Max Webster, something in the combination of musicianship and zaniness. There
was this zany quality, but also a sense that these guys are players; they can play and they want to
play.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> We sure fooled you. [laughs]
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> Right on. [both laugh] But it's quite a different sound live to me, a much heavier
sound. There's a hypnotic appeal to a lot of the rhythmic stuff that you do on stage that didn't
come through to me on that record. When you first started playing with us, I was impressed with
the quality of the musicianship and certainly your approach to playing bass, which I think is
unique, very individual. I don't think there's a lot of guys playing like you play; the whole rhythmic
approach to bass playing is very hypnotic. I also thought the complexity and just the texture of a
lot of your arrangements was really interesting.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> I think a lot of hypnotic quality could be attributed to the abundance of pot smoke
that was floating through the air of the auditorium. [both laugh] As far as us being heavier live, I
think that's due to us not being very good producers quite yet. [laughs] We're still trying, you
know. So, has your son ventured out to rock shows on his own?
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> No, not yet. He's express(ed) interest in some bands, and actually he's been
listening to _Pork Soda_ a lot lately.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Better get him to some therapy real quick.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> It's probably putting him off rock music forever. [both laugh]
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> The Rush show was actually my first, aside from going to dances and seeing Top 40
or whatever. I had to call my dad at work and say, "Friends of mine are going to a show tonight,
and I want to go," and we actually got a ticket from a scalper, but it was like, "Who's driving?
Who's doing this?"
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> At least he asked those questions. It's amazing how many kids come up to me
and tell me that we were the first rock show they saw. It still happens, which is amazing, since -
being around this long - you'd think most people in the audience would be 40 years old, but
they're not. There's a lot of young guys that, for some reason, cut their teeth on our shows or
something.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Well, I think this new album will open a lot of young people up to it as well. Right
now it's a time for a lot of new albums from a lot of heavy bands - Nirvana and Pearl Jam - so
we've been getting these CDs in and listening to them, and it's, like, this Rush album is definitely a
big, fat thing.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> That's what we were after. The main thing we decided when we started planning
this record out was that we wanted to go away from the sound we had on the last couple albums;
we wanted a less polite, more aggressive, larger sound. We wanted the bottom-end-of-the-band
thump again. We were a little disappointed in the last album [_Roll the Bones_
(Anthem/Atlantic)] from a sound point of view, because there were a couple of songs we wanted
to rock out more, but when it came time to mixing, it just wasn't there to be had. Through the last
tour, when we were playing some of the stuff from the last album, to me it just sounded better
live. It was like, lights go on and go, "We're doing something wrong; we're not capturing a sound
that should be gotten on stage."
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Well definitely the new album, as I told you when we were hanging out up in your
zone, has the huge, fat Geddy Lee signature tone of my youth.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> Oh, that one.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> So maybe you can tell all the people what you told me as far as how you got that
sucker. Unless you don't want to spill your secrets.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> No, no secrets. Ancient Chinese secrets. Basically it all started with the desire to
be less polite on this record, and a comment that our producer made to me, Peter Collins, when
we started talking about this record. It was also a comment that our sound guy had made a
couple of times on the last tour that maybe my sound was getting a little tame, a little polite. So I
thought about it and I thought, "Okay, I can unpolite my sound, no problem." We did a lot of
A/B-ing with different records and our own records; we were really quite determined to get that
down.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> We do a lot of A/B-ing when we're in the studio with different records, and one of
the records that we A/B always is _Moving Pictures_. It's just got the big, fat sound. You can
A/B yours with _Seas of Cheese_ to find out what you don't want it to sound like. [both laugh]
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> You can drive yourself crazy with production. The main thing is if the material is
there and the performance is vibing. You can twiddle forever. There's the whole Mutt Lange
school of making records where you just twiddle for four years ...
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Who's that?
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> Mutt Lange - he produces Def Leppard, Bryan Adams, so on and so forth. You
can spend a couple or four years making a record, and every hair is in place and everything is
sonically correct, but I don't know that a band like ours or a band like yours, that enjoy playing
and have a degree of spontaneity, I don't think either of us could serve that style of production.
There has to be a way in between so you're not so stale by the time you go to play. I know to
Neil it's increasingly more important to him to have someone who can capture the sound of his
drums so he can just get in there and start wailing.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Is he pretty particular?
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> It's funny; he's particular about everything he plays, and he practices two solid
weeks before he goes in to do his drums, and he has everything orchestrated to a "T," and he's
very particular on how his drums sound - he tunes them impeccably - but he doesn't like to bang
those drums for days to get that sound. Fortunately, the last two engineers we've worked with
have been very good, and the guy who recorded Neil's drums on this album, I think, has done
the best job of recording his sound of anybody. He did 11 tracks in two-and-a-half days, which
is insanely fast for this kind of rock record. I think you have to have a pretty together team for
that to happen; all the planets have to be aligned and all that stuff. [laughs]
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> I'm finding that the more I'm familiar with the equipment and can actually get in there
hands-on, the better off things are. The same with Larry [LaLonde - Primus' guitarist, AKA
"Ler"] and Herb [Tim Alexander, AKA Herb - Primus' drummer]; Herb has so many drums, and
he knows what he wants to hear, and I see him get so frustrated when he can't hear the subtlety
of a certain drum.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> Alex [Lifeson - Rush's guitarist] takes that approach: he likes to be very
hands-on, he engineers all our demos. Whenever he and I write together he runs the machines -
which is the exact opposite of me, because I don't want to know how anything operates, I just
want it to work. I got an idea, I want to get it on tape, I don't want to sit there and analyze
whether it should have this EQ or that EQ. To me, the ideas are precious, and the spontaneity in
the writing process is something I really feel is very valuable, so I like to have the least confusion
between what I hear in my head and what I want to play. I always keep a tape recorder running,
because sometimes while you're diddling, you lose that spark somewhere.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Well, my experience with Alex in his studio was pretty a ... we were just drunk out of
our minds. I couldn't even figure out how to play the bass.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> You're saying it wasn't a musical experience but a visceral experience.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> It was a scary experience. It was the first time I'd ever picked up my bass and just
couldn't do anything, and he was exactly the same on his guitar.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> You gotta watch out for Big Al. [both laugh]
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Big Al was in full force, and whatever I was. I was slurring Les. And Ler was just
comatose somewhere. Slur and Ler. [Both laugh, again. What is this, Beavis and Butt-head? -
Ed.]
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> When you guys write, do you write all together?
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> It depends. The thing about us is that, because the band had been around for four
years before Larry and Herb had even gotten in the band, we had a ton of tunes, so there were a
lot of tunes just to do already, and Larry and Herb interpreted them as they would. It hasn't been
until these past couple records that we've been able to write, and _Pork Soda_ is really the only
record where most of the record has been completely new. A lot of it comes from just jamming,
mostly me and Herb. We'll come up with a riff or a groove and try like hell to remember it, and
then Ler will generally put some textural thing over it.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> And do you then write lyrics and put a melody to the music you've already
written?
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> I have a lot of notebooks lying around with maybe just a sentence or just a couple of
words or a short story or whatever, and sometimes I'll flip through them and something will spark
with a riff that we happen to be jamming on recently or a lyric will inspire a riff. And some songs I
just write and arrange myself.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> When you write by yourself, do you start with lyrics or start with music, or does
it differ?
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> It's always different. Certain riffs will spark a certain mood or a strange little ditty in
my head, and it'll go from there.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> When you do riffs first, do you always write on the bass or do you write on the
guitar sometimes?
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> I've written a couple things on guitar, but I'm not a very good guitarist; I mostly play
drums if I play anything. But mainly it's the bass.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> Listening to you describe how you write is so similar to how we write in a lot of
ways. At one point in our career, maybe eight or ten years ago, so many of our songs were
written out of jams - they still are to a certain degree - but we used to jam every sound check. It
was the best part of the day. We used to have a standing rule that the sound guy would have to
record every jam. And then I'd get home from the tour and have these hours of ... crap. [laughs]
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> That you thought was the greatest thing at the time. [laughs]
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> That's right. And after hours of isolating and editing and editing, you wind up with
45 minutes of snippets. But sometimes great ideas come out of that.

<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> I've found that, with Larry and Herb, our best material is spontaneous and it's stuff
that I go into without much of a preconceived idea as to what it should sound like. But there's a
lot of stuff that will never make it to Primus records, which is one reason why Prawn Song [his
indie label] is so good a thing for me, because I can make these weird things and put them out
and have them not be Primus. Those two are such characters, as people and playing-wise as
well, I think they shine the best when I'm not trying to get them to do something that isn't natural
for them. There's definitely a "Herb riff," that's what Herb really enjoys playing, this certain
driving rhythm. Just as with me there's some certain driving funk-type rhythms that I enjoy
playing, which isn't necessarily right for Primus. I've been playing with a lot of jazz and R&B
musicians lately, which is great for my chops. I'm always finding that playing with other people
makes my chops that much better, and when we come together as Primus, it can be Primus, and
not a yearning for something new.
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> I think that's one thing, for all the benefits of being in one band for so 20 years
and dedicating ourselves to this one musical idea, but we've become a little insular in the sense
that we haven't had enough access to other musical scenes. In one sense it's been a saving grace
for our band, it's kept our sound pure and sincere, but on the other side, there's a lot of
opportunities to work with other people that would be good on some point. We could say, "Rush
isn't going away, we can take a year out and do other things." It might be coming to that time.
<BR><BR><B>LES:</B> Have you been approach-ed by anyone?
<BR><BR><B>GEDDY:</B> I've been approached by many people over the years, but it's always, "I'm in the
middle of a Rush tour," or, "I'm about to start a Rush album," or, "I've just finished a Rush tour;
do I want to spend my precious few months off going straight into a studio with somebody else?"
It's difficult enough finding time to have a life. </FONT>
