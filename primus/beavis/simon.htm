<p>
The Northern California avant-rock trio Primus provides a shining 
example for bands who want to 
succeed on their own terms. Fusing the skittering rhythmic 
attack of progressive-metal bands like Rush, the groove of 
funk and hippie rock, and the eccentricity 
of such experimental artists as <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_77495">Frank Zappa</a>, the Residents, and <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_5224">Captain Beefheart</a>, Primus has followed its 
own musical calling to large-scale industry success. Fronted by bassist-vocalist Les Claypool, who can produce 
thousands of bizarre tones on his 
instrument and almost as many cartoonish 
characters with his voice, Primus has journeyed from 
the underground to the headlining spot 
at the 1993 Lollapalooza music festival, arguably the nation's most important alternative rock tour. Joe Gore of <i>Guitar Player</i> cited guitarist Larry "Ler" LaLonde's description of the group's sound as "progressive freak-out music"; Gore also noted what 
he called "the Primus paradox: if your music is <i>really</i> uncommercial, you can sell 
a ton of records." 
<p>
Like LaLonde, Claypool grew up in 
the northern California town of El Sobrante. "I was raised in 
the land of Budweiser," he quipped to <i>Rolling Stone'</i> s Michael Azerrad. Having been raised in a working-class family--his father and grandfather 
both worked as mechanics--helped form Claypool's worldview but also 
sharpened his resolve to escape his hometown's oppressive normalcy. "I would have blasted 
out one way or another," he insisted. His mother told Azerrad that Les "was a bouncing boy. He used to like 
to jump in his jumpy chair. I think that's where he got 
the strength in his legs. I never saw anybody 
who could jump as well as 
he did in that jumpy chair." 
<p>
Claypool's mother also remembered 
that her son "liked to watch TV a lot. I think that's where he got 
a lot of ideas. He'd sit there on 
his little tiny plastic motorcycle that 
he had and watch cartoons." Les acquired his first 
bass at age 13; "I pulled weeds to 
pay for it," he told <i>Guitar Player.</i> He recalled to <i>Rolling Stone</i> that he "sat in front of 
the television and noodled" after first hearing hard-rock guitarist <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_52294">Ted Nugent</a>. 
<p>
In the ensuing years, his eclecticism alienated 
most of the single-minded rock players around him. On the one hand, Claypool worshipped the bassist 
and leader of Rush--"If it wasn't for Geddy Lee," he has declared, "I probably wouldn't be playing bass"--but also adored funk pioneer <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_28738">Larry Graham</a>, the bottom end 
of the psychedelic soul-rock band Sly and the Family Stone. He was equally enamored 
of jazz and fusion masters like <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_13963">Stanley Clarke</a>. Claypool found a kindred 
spirit in LaLonde, who joined his art-metal project Blind Illusion. LaLonde--who learned much of 
his technique at the feet of 
guitar guru Joe Satriani--also played in a "satanic" metal band called the Possessed as a teenager. 
<p>
Claypool further honed his 
chops in "biker bars" as bassist for an R&B cover troupe called the Tommy Crank Band. "It was four sets a night, up to five 
nights a week--that's how I learned discipline and 
how to actually groove," he explained to <i>Guitar Player'</i> s Gore. After that, in 1984, he assembled the 
first version of Primus--initially called Primate--with guitarist Todd Huth and a drum machine. The group gathered a 
following over the next few years, and Claypool's do-it-yourself ethic extended to 
buying a printing press and making T-shirts for his and his friends' bands. Drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander finally stuck, replacing Jay Lane, but the day after Claypool asked Alexander to join the group, Huth quit. 
<p>
For a moment, Claypool thought his claim 
to fame would be as the 
bassist for the up-and-coming (and later superstar) metal group Metallica. Original bassist Cliff Burton had been killed 
in a bus accident, and as a 
childhood friend of guitarist Kirk Hammett, Claypool got a chance 
to audition for the spot; but his affinity for R&B acts like the <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_35326">Isley Brothers</a> scared the headbangers off. Eventually, he recruited LaLonde to take Huth's place in a revamped Primus. The group was two-thirds new, but LaLonde undertook the arduous 
task of learning all of Huth's parts and then 
participating in a live recording that 
became the first Primus album, <i>Suck on This.</i> Released in 1989 on the group's own Prawn Song label, it was financed with $3,000 borrowed from Claypool's father. "The three of us 
had a chemistry that sounded like Primus," the bassist recalled in <i>Rolling Stone,</i> "but it was different than before. I was nervous as 
hell the first show we did, but our original 
fans accepted us." 
<p>
Long before LaLonde and Alexander joined the band, Claypool explained to Rolling Stone, the group's fans had begun chanting "You Suck" as an honorific 
at their shows. "People would follow us 
around telling us how cool we were, and we'd be like 'Nah, we suck.' It evolved, and then it 
became good marketing. We'd go down the street, and someone will yell, 'You suck,' and I'll say 'Oh, thank you very much,' which freaks out whoever's with you.'" Soon "Primus Sucks" appeared on T-shirts and became a <i>de rigeur</i> slogan on the Bay Area music scene. The group's sound--which caught the attention 
of critics during the ascent of metal/funk hybrids like the <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_58374">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> and Faith No More--began to be categorized as "funk-rock," though Alexander despised funk and Claypool has always protested 
that real funk doesn't sound anything like his band. 
<p>
In any event, Claypool's busy, percussive bass lines crisscrossed Alexander's tight beats and allowed LaLonde--whose guitar idols are 
sainted rock experimentalists Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia--to explore, rather than merely hold down, the group's songs. Claypool's lyrics tend to 
be loopy character studies, often sung in 
voices that critics have frequently compared 
to cartoon voice-over wizard Mel Blanc. Claypool told <i>Musician</i> that he tended 
at first to write "statement" songs, but ultimately, he revealed, "[I] found that's not me, to preach social 
ideas as music. I'm putting down observations, and sometimes it 
may just be crap." 
<p>
Following the cult success of <i>Suck on This,</i> the band signed 
with noted independent label Caroline Records, which reissued their 
debut and released the follow-up, 1990's <i>Frizzle Fry,</i> produced by Primus's 19-year-old friend Matt Winegar. "The Northern California thrash-funk trio recaptures the 
anarchic spontaneity of their debut (the high-energy, low-budget <i>Suck on This</i>)," opined <i>Guitar Player,</i> "but with tighter performances 
and better production." The review praised the "visceral punch" of LaLonde's "angular lines" and noted that Claypool "hammers out dense but 
groovy lines that flesh out the 
bony trio texture." The band toured exhaustively 
in support of the album and 
soon landed a deal with a major label, Interscope, a joint venture with Atlantic Records. 
<p>
In 1991 Claypool and company released <i>Sailing the Seas of Cheese,</i> a further refinement 
of their sound. "In many ways the more metallic, undulating <i>Frizzle Fry</i> is a better 
document of the ugliness and energy 
that is Primus," reflected <i>Musician'</i> s Matt Resnicoff, "though <i>Cheese'</i> s pristine presentation 
captures its own space in a 
world where saying something sucks is 
like a love tap." <i>Guitar Player</i> marveled at the group's eclecticism: "These avant-headbangers combine speed metal energy, funkoid groove, and art-rock quirkiness (imagine Metallica, Rush, and the Chili Peppers liquified in a blender)." <i>Cheese</i> included the rampaging 
and irresistible single "Tommy the Cat," which featured a 
cameo vocal by gravelly voiced singer-songwriter Tom Waits and was selected 
for the soundtrack to the film <i>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey,</i> in which Primus briefly appeared. <i>Cheese</i> went gold in April of 1993. 
<p>
Also in 1993-in some sense the band's breakthrough year--Primus received widespread public 
attention when they were named headliner 
of the Lollapalooza rock festival. This assignment helped their new album, <i>Pork Soda,</i> debut at Number Seven on the <i>Billboard</i> pop chart, a previously unheard-of feat for such 
an unconventional band. In a feature on Lollapalooza, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> insisted, "There's no resisting the frenetic danceability" of the trio's "P-Funk meets Captain Beefheart set," adding, "If this band could 
write a melody--or, God forbid, a power ballad--it would rule the entire planet." 
<p>
<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called <i>Pork Soda</i> "a musical hiccup--a gnarly, funkadelic mix of 
metal and art rock highlighted by Claypool's slaphappy bass lines and carnival-barker voice." <i>Rolling Stone</i> deemed the album "a weird, whimsical grab bag." <i>Pork Soda</i> featured the romps "My Name Is Mud" and "Mr. Krinkle," both of which spawned grotesque, surrealistic videos. Of Primus's Lollapalooza offering, <i>Entertainment Today</i> claimed, "They put on a 
superior show that was remarkably tight 
and demonstrated they were the right 
choice for the closing band." 
<p>
Primus recorded <i>Pork Soda</i> at minimal cost 
by bringing digital recording equipment into 
their rehearsal space rather than renting studio time. "The quality we got 
on this record has a lot 
to do with the sheer quantity 
of things we could afford to record," Claypool explained to <i>Guitar Player'</i> s Gore. "Had we gone into 
an expensive studio and tried to 
do what we did, this album would 
have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. We wouldn't have done nearly 
so many abstract things." This home studio--known as From the Corn--has afforded Primus the opportunity to 
record other projects, such as a 
collaboration among Claypool, Metallica guitarist Hammett, and <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_23027">Faith No More</a> drummer Mike Bordin, as well as 
records by former Primus guitarist Huth's band Porch and Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy guitarist <a href="http://www.musicblvd.com/cgi-bin/tw/262718878628013_42_34496">Charlie Hunter</a>'s side band. Primus hoped to release 
some of these recordings on the revamped Prawn Song. In other artistic explorations, Claypool collaborated with Lance Montoya on the whimsical 
clay sculpture that graces the cover of <i>Pork Soda.</i> 
<p>
With major label support, Primus has emerged as 
one of the most musically daring 
acts in rock, yet its bizarre cross-fertilizations flourish in a 
garden of relative independence. It's the best of both worlds, and Claypool knows it: staying involved in 
all aspects of his band's work "gives you confidence," he insisted to <i>Guitar Player,</i> "and that's the most important 
thing to have in any aspect 
of the music business."
